<h3>Adding test cases</h3>
<p>This section covers managing the test cases of the test suite. A test suite 
  may contain an arbitrary number of test cases. One test case represents one 
  complete interaction with the PUT, from the initial message sent into the PUT 
  to the last message received from the PUT.</p>
<p>BPELUnit test cases consist of specifications of interactions with the PUT. 
  Each test case contains several partner tracks (at most one for each specified 
  partner of the PUT). The partner tracks each contain a sequence of activities 
  which describe the frameworks actions on behalf of the partner in the given 
  test case. Besides the actual partners which are specified in the Partners section 
  of the editor, one additional partner, the client of the PUT, must be specified.</p>
<p>The Test Cases and Tracks section looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/editor_section_testcases.gif" width="395" height="257"></p>
<p>Each test case is identified by a human-readable name. These names are displayed 
  as root nodes in the test case and tracks tree view. A test case may have any 
  number of partners, selected from the partners in the Partners section, and 
  one client, which are displayed as children of the test cases in the tree.</p>
<p>The following screen shot shows an example of editing a test case. The selected 
  test case is not based on another test case and is non-abstract, and non-varying 
  (see below for an explanation).</p>

<p>For the users convenience, anew test case is generated with all available partners 
  and the client as partner tracks. Mostly, you will not need to change this, 
  however by right-clicking on a test case, you may add new partner tracks; by 
  selecting a partner track, you can edit or remove it. Note that it is not possible 
  to remove the client track, as each test case needs a client.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows an example of adding a new partner track.</p>

<p>The following two sections contain more in-depth information about the test 
  case concept of BPELUnit.</p>
<h4>The test case inheritance concept</h4>
<p>BPELUnit employs an inheritance concept for test cases. A test case may be 
  <em>based on</em> another test case - creating an inheritance link between the 
  two test cases. A test case which is based on another test case <em>inherits</em> 
  activities of <em>empty partner tracks</em> from its parent.</p>
<p>A test case may also be declared <em>abstract</em>. In this case, the test 
  case is not run itself, but may be used as a parent by other test cases.</p>
<h4>The test case variation concept</h4>
<p>One of the most basic concepts in the BPEL is a language is the FLOW, i.e., 
  executing several sequences of activities in parallel. Testing such flows involves 
  varying the arrival times of messages received inside the FLOW block. BPELUnit 
  supports this with the concept of a varied test case.</p>
<p>A varied test case is executed multiple times. Each send activity within a 
  varied test case may have a delay sequence, which is a list of delay times. 
  Upon execution of the test case, the specified delay time is introduced by the 
  BPELUnit framework. </p>
