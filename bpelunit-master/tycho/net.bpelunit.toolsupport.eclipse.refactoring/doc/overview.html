<h3>Welcome to the BPELUnit Tool Support</h3>
<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>BPELUnit is a unit testing framework for testing BPEL compositions, that is, 
  software programs that are written in the Business Process Execution Language 
  (BPEL). BPEL is a web service orchestration language - its intended purpose 
  is to compose, or orchestrate, web services to form a new web service, thereby 
  integrating several web services into one. BPEL is a language for <em>programming 
  in the large</em>.</p>
<p>BPELUnit enables BPEL programmers to test their BPEL compositions in a white-box, 
  unit-testing fashion: During a test run, the client and all partners of a BPEL 
  process are simulated by BPELUnit. Testers formulate test cases for BPEL processes 
  by using the BPELUnit XML-based test specification language, which allows them 
  to instruct BPELUnit which data to send into the process and what data to expect 
  at each of the simulated endpoints.</p>
<p>In BPELUnit, all the information about the test cases for a BPEL process reside 
  inside the test suite specification file; an XML file with a &quot;.bpts&quot; 
  ending. These files may be edited directly in XML or by specialized editors; 
  the BPELUnit Tool Support provides such an editor.</p>
<h4>About the BPELUnit Tool Support</h4>
<p>This documentation is part of the BPELUnit Tool Support, which contains a wizard 
  for creating new test suites and a form-based editor for BPEL Test Suite Specification 
  files. </p>
