<h3>Editor Overview</h3>
<p>The BPELUnit Test Suite Editor offers a graphical interface for editing all 
  parts of a test suite document. The editor has two pages; a visual page which 
  allows editing by means of a graphical user interface and wizards, and a source 
  page which allows editing of the Test Suite source code.</p>
<p><img src="images/editor_main.gif" width="824" height="620"></p>
<p>The visual editor window consists of five sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Test Suite</strong> section. This section offers basic options of 
    the test suite, like its name,base URL, and a link to the namespace prefix 
    editor.</li>
  <li><strong>Process Under Test</strong> section. This secton offers configuration 
    of the Process Under Test (PUT), like its name, type, WSDL file, and deployment 
    options.</li>
  <li><strong>Partners</strong> section. This section allows adding, editing, 
    and removing of partners.</li>
  <li><strong>Test Cases and Tracks</strong> section. This section allows adding, 
    editing, removing, and moving of test cases, and their partner tracks.</li>
  <li><strong>Activities</strong> section. This section allows adding, editing, 
    removing, and moving activities of a selected partner track.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making changes in either the Visual and the Source page will be immediately 
  reflected in the other page. It is thus safe to switch between the pages at 
  any given time.</p>
