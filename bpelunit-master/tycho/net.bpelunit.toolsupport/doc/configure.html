<h3>Configuring the test suite</h3>
<p>This section covers the basic test suite configuration - creating and changing 
  the options of the test suite itself, the PUT, and the partners of the PUT.</p>
<h4>The Test Suite section</h4>
<p>Let's first take a look at the test suite section:</p>
<p><img src="images/editor_section_testsuite.gif" width="396" height="110"></p>
<p>There are two text fields:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Suite name</strong>. The suite name is an arbitrary, human-readable 
    name of this suite, used to identify the suite in the test result outputs.</li>
  <li><strong>Base URL</strong>. This field is optional, if not specified, the 
    URL defaults to http://localhost:7777/ws. BPELUnit includes a HTTP server, 
    which listens for incoming transmissions targeted at partners being sent from 
    the process under test (PUT). When configuring the PUT for testing, the SOAP 
    URL location of the partner must be changed in the partners WSDL from the 
    actual location to the test location. This test location is a concatenation 
    of the base URL and the partner name, which will be specified in the <em>Partner 
    Section</em> (see below). An example of a full test location would be http://localhost:7777/ws/airline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there is a link to the namespace prefix editor. Namespaces are 
  very important in the test suite document, as the literal data to be sent to 
  the PUT, and the XPath conditions used for verifying incoming transmissions 
  and copying values must be formulated with the right namespace URIs. When adding 
  WSDL files to the test suites, their target namespaces will automatically be 
  added and a prefix will be generated. To change these prefixes or add new namespaces, 
  click on the <em>Configure Namespace Prefixes... </em>hyperlink to open the 
  following editor: </p>
<p><img src="images/wizard_namespace.gif" width="438" height="415"></p>
<p>Click <em>Add</em> to add a namespace declaration, <em>Edit</em> to change 
  an existing namespace (either prefix or URL) and <em>Remove</em> to remove a 
  namespace declaration. Note that editing a prefix will change the prefix in 
  the complete document. Removing a namespace, however, may leave unresolvable 
  prefixes in the document.</p>
<h4>The Process Under Test Section</h4>
<p>The Process Under Test (PUT) section allows specification of the BPEL process 
  which will be tested in this test suite:</p>
<p><img src="images/editor_section_put.gif" width="398" height="144"></p>
<p>There are three text fields:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PUT Name</strong>. This is the name of the BPEL process, and must 
    match the process name as specified in the BPEL process description. It is 
    used by BPELUnit to reference the PUT inside the test suite document, and 
    may be used by deployers for deploying the PUT.</li>
  <li><strong>PUT Type</strong>. This is the deployment type of the PUT. You may 
    select any of the deployers currently registered in BPELUnit. See the &quot;Extending 
    BPELUnit&quot; section for information about adding your own deployers.</li>
  <li><strong>WSDL</strong>. This is the WSDL process description of the BPEL 
    process. The path is relative to the .bpts file. It is good practise to assemble 
    all relevant files for the test suite in either the same or a subdirectory 
    of the .bpts file. If you click on <em>Browse...</em>, you will be presented 
    with a dialog for selecting a WSDL file. Selecting a WSDL file this way also 
    adds a prefix for the target namespace of the WSDL file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there is a link which opens the deployment options wizard. This 
  wizard allows adding deployment options for the selected deployer. The deployment 
  format is different for each BPEL engine and deployer, and so are the options. 
  The following screenshot shows an example configuration for the Oracle deployer:</p>
<p><img src="images/wizard_deployment_options.gif" width="425" height="342"></p>
<p>Click <em>Add</em> to add a deyploment option, <em>Edit</em> to change an existing 
  deployment option, and <em>Remove</em> to remove a deployment option. Depending 
  on the selected deployer, the available keys will be presented to you when adding 
  and editing options.</p>
<h3>The Partners section</h3>
<p>In the Partners section, you may add, edit, or remove the partners to be simulated 
  in this test suite. A BPEL process can have an arbitrary number of partners, 
  and it is up to you to decide which partners should be simulated. </p>
<p><img src="images/editor_section_partners.gif" width="396" height="150"></p>
<p>Click Add, Edit, or Remove to change the simulated partners of the PUT. Each 
  partner has a name which identifies the partner in the test suite document, 
  and also forms the second part of the simulated partner URL (the partner name 
  must be appended to the Base URL when configuring the partner WSDL for the test). 
  Besides the name, the partner WSDL must also be specified. The WSDL service 
  definition will be used by the framework to extract encoding and style options 
  for the SOAP operations.</p>
<p>The following screen shot shows an example of editing a partner:</p>
<p><img src="images/wizard_partner.gif" width="405" height="177"></p>
<p>The given WSDL file will be validated and a prefix for the target namespace 
  will be added when selecting OK.</p>
