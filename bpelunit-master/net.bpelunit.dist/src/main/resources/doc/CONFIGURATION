BPELUnit - A BPEL testing framework
www.bpelunit.org

----------------------------------------------------------

= Configuration =

In order to keep the test suite documents free from platform-specific settings,
the registered deployers of BPELUnit may be configured by using the conf/configuration.xml
file. In this XML file, each deployer may be parameterized with a number of options.

BPELUnit contains two deployers: The Oracle Deployer and the ActiveBPEL deployer. To
configure one of these deployers (or a deployer you have added yourself), create a section
for it in the configuration.xml file:

	<configuration deployer="oracle">
		...
	</configuration>
	
Inside of this block, you can parameterize the deployer with the set of keys it provides, for example:

		<property name="OracleDomainPassword">bpel</property>
		
The options for the Oracle and ActiveBPEL Deployers are as follows:

Oracle
======

Key								Value

OracleDirectory					The absolute file path to the Oracle BPEL server directory.
OracleDomain					The name of the Oracle Domain to deploy to.
OracleDomainPassword			The password for the specified domain.


ActiveBPEL
======

Key								Value
ActiveBPELDeploymentDirectory	The directory of the ActiveBPEL Tomcat installation containing the .bpr files
ActiveBPELDeploymentServiceURL	The URL to the ActiveBPEL deployment web service.
